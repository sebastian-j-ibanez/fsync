**fsync** is a CLI tool designed to sync files between devices. The protocol is entirely P2P, eliminating the need for a server or cloud instance.

## Example
Sync the ~/Pictures directory between two computers on a private network (Computer B has the pictures):
### Computer A
```
cd ~/Pictures
fsync listen --scan
```
### Computer B
```
cd ~/Pictures
fsync sync --scan
```
## Use Cases
- Sync wallpapers between devices
- Share video files

## Disclaimer
**fsync** is in early alpha. There is no gurantee on software quality or stability.
